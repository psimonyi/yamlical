            A great mid-week dance held in a beautiful century hall on the 4th
            Tuesday of the month, with our local community band Stolen Goods
            and the Ottawa Callers' Collective.
            
            The evening starts with a short workshop to get beginners started,
            and the first half will focus on building skills — a great way to
            learn more, and plenty of dancing for all!

            Sometimes Esther will organize a dinner meet-up beforehand at a
            local restaurant.  Join our email list to get the details.

            Admission: $8 (students and members: $6) (ages 15 and under: free)

            Everyone is welcome, no dance experience required.  Come alone or

            Think big barn dance party!
            This lovely event has varied programming with accessible dances
            that are a little more structured than family dances yet less
            demanding than evening contras.

            Catering to a multigenerational crowd, this dance is great for
            school-age kids and pre-teens to adults, and offers a transition
            into contra dancing.

            Hosted by Esther Fraser & Emily Addison.

            Plus, join us for a pot-luck dinner before the dance at 5:15pm,
            right after the afternoon advanced dance.  Bring something to share
            (and a plate and cutlery). These are popular and friendly!

            Musicians: There's an open band you can play in — and drop-in
            musicians get free admission.

            Contra dancers: If you pay for the evening contra dance, the
            community dance is free!  It's right before the contra, so just
            show up a little early to get some extra dancing in.

            Admission: $5 (under age 2: free) (family rate, max 2 adults: $20)
