      detail: Come take a trip to France with Mary Wesley and Triton! Balfolk
          dancing is popular social dancing from Western Europe, a recent
          revival of traditional, mostly French, folk dances. These include
          Breton dances from the northwestern, historically celtic region of
          France known as Brittany. Balfolk and Breton dances range in form
          from partnered dances (waltz, schottish, mazurka), circle and
          longways sets (chappelloise and bourées) and "la danse en chaîne,"
          chain dances combining a variety of steps and arm movements (hanter
          dro, andro, and many more)! These dances and the tunes that go with
          them are beautiful and mesmerizing. Venez dansez! All dances are
          accessible to beginners and will be enthusiastically taught.
