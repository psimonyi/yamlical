DESCRIPTION:Think big barn dance party! This lovely event has varied progr
 amming with accessible dances that are a little more structured than famil
 y dances yet less demanding than evening contras.\n\nCatering to a multige
 nerational crowd\, this dance is great for school-age kids and pre-teens t
 o adults\, and offers a transition into contra dancing.\n\nHosted by Esthe
 r Fraser & Emily Addison.\n\nPlus\, join us for a pot-luck dinner before t
 he dance at 5:15pm\, right after the afternoon advanced dance.  Bring some
 thing to share (and a plate and cutlery). These are popular and friendly!\
 n\nMusicians: There's an open band you can play in — and drop-in musicia
 ns get free admission.\n\nContra dancers: If you pay for the evening contr
 a dance\, the community dance is free!  You're here anyway\, so why not jo
 in in?\n\nAdmission: $5 (under age 2: free) (family rate\, max 2 adults: $
 20)
