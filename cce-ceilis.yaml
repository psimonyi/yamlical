    blurb: Award winning ceili band playing great Irish dance music. Dances are
        called with brief instruction beforehand. No prior experience
        necessary.  You don't need to be with a partner, one can always be
        found for your time on the dancefloor. Cash bar, non-alcoholic
        beverages, Irish bread, cheese and jam at the break time, 50/50 draw,
        door prizes, and local entertainment. A bargain for students, $5; $10
        for members, and $15 for non-members. Tickets for the Matt Cranitch and
        Jackie Daly Concert (14 March) and the big March Ceili Dinner and Dance
        will also be available for sale at the ceili.
